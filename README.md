# SA-MP-PUBG
This gamemode that was plan to run in Thailand, But I have no time much to develop it.

## First ...

You can edit game settings by going to
- gamemodes\includes\main\matchmaking\main.pwn
```
MAX_PLAYER_PER_MATCH // Player per match
MAX_MATCHINGINFO // maximum match, recommend 1-3 maximum is 5
MIN_PLAYER_FOR_START // min player on match before start countdown
TIME_WAITING_TO_START // wait time for going to plane
TIME_BEFORE_FINISH // time after match end
```

And searching for 'CircleData' to edit circle shrink time

ENJOY...
